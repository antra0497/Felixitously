## Problem Statement
The cost of living crisis is adding huge pressure to the lives of the people that Felix serves. Record consumer inflation together with the spike in energy prices means that many more families are facing the choice to “eat or heat”. Many people are not aware of the most efficient ways to store, use and prepare different foods; nor do they know how to put together balanced nutritious meals. Families often have ingredients and leftovers that go to waste, simply because they are unaware of what to do with them. Felix want to help address this knowledge gap through a simplified user experience that suggests recipes based on a collection of household food items. The cheaper, the easier and the less wasteful it is for a regular household consumer, the more likely they will be to use it.
